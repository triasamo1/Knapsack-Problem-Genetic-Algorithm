# Solving the Knapsack Problem using Genetic Algorithm  

In the **Knapsack Problem**, we need to fill our knapsack with items(in the range of N items) gathering the highest possible total value, while having one restriction:  
* The total weight of all items selected must not exceed the weight limit of our knapsack.  

**main_ga.m** includes the Genetic Algorithm code of this implementation.  
**my_fitness.m** includes the code that calculates the fitness score of each chromosome.  
The **knapsack.xls** file includes the data used for this problem. The first two rows are used to diplay the weight limit of our knapsack and the number of items we have in our inventory.  
* 1st column holds the __item_ID__
* 2nd column holds the __item_weight__
* 3rd column holds the __item_value__
